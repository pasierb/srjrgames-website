# Tech education or just playing games?

People often ask me: "Isn't he just playing on the computer?" 

The answer is both yes and no. Yes, we are playing, but we are playing with the *tools* of creation. Game development is a multi-disciplinary field that covers:

- **Logic and Flow**: If A then B, else C.
- **Mathematics**: Coordinates, vectors, and physics.
- **Visual Arts**: Composition, color theory, and animation.
- **Storytelling**: Narrative arcs and character development.

## Beyond the Code

When we build a game, we're not just learning syntax. We're learning **problem-solving**. We're learning how to break down a large, overwhelming goal into small, manageable tasks.

That's the real education.
