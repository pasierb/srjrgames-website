# My favorite part of building Digeon

Building the game with Dad is awesome! My favorite part is definitely the **character design**. 

## Digeon's Tie

I spent a long time drawing Digeon. He's a blue pigeon because blue is my favorite color. But he needed to look professional since he's on a quest. So I gave him a tie. 

Dad helped me use the "AnimationPlayer" in Godot to make the tie flap when Digeon runs. It looks so funny!

## Level Design

I also like making the levels. Sometimes Dad says they are "too hard" and "impossible to beat," but I think he just needs more practice!

I want to add a secret level where everything is made of candy.
