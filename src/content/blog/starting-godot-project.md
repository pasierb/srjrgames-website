# Starting our first Godot project together

Deciding on a game engine was our first big hurdle. We looked at Unity, Unreal, and even Scratch, but ultimately landed on **Godot**. 

Why Godot?
- It's open source and lightweight.
- The node-based system is very intuitive for explaining hierarchies to a child.
- GDScript is close enough to Python that it serves as a great introductory programming language.

## The First Steps

We started by creating a simple "Player" node. Junior insisted the player should be a pigeon, so "Digeon" was born. We spent the first hour just making him move left and right. 

The excitement on Junior's face when he pressed a key and saw his drawing move was worth every minute of debugging!

## Tips for Parents

1. **Keep it short**: Sessions shouldn't last more than 45-60 minutes.
2. **Follow their lead**: If they want the character to wear a tie, let them draw a tie.
3. **Celebrate small wins**: Making a character jump is a huge milestone!
